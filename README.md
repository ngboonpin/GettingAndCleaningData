# Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
  * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Running the script
  * Clone the repository
  * Download the [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  * Please extract downloaded data set to folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
  * You should find all the required files are available at folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
  * Open run_analysis.R, please modify setwd() path to "UCI HAR Dataset".
  * Run run_analysis.R
  * Tidy dataset will be created at the path you set earlier.
  * Code book for tidy dataset is available [here](https://github.com/ngboonpin/GettingAndCleaningData/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
